# Monitors

Proactively monitor your data in OpenSearch with alerting and anomaly detection. Set up alerts to receive notifications when your data exceeds certain thresholds. Anomaly detection uses machine learning to automatically detect any outliers in your streaming data. You can pair anomaly detection with alerting to ensure you're notified as soon as an anomaly is detected.
