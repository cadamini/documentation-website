# OpenSearch Integrations
Introduced 2.9
{: .label .label-purple }

OpenSearch Integrations connects your data, applications, and processes so that you can centrally manage the services you use. All integrations are available in a single view, and OpenSearch Dashboards guides you there from the home page and main menu.

The OpenSearch Project seeks your feedback on this feature. Let us know how OpenSearch Integrations works for you or how it can be improved at <insert-link>. For the developer guide, code, and other backend user information, go to the [Integrations repository](https://github.com/opensearch-project/observability/tree/e18cf354fd7720a6d5df6a6de5d53e51a9d43127/integrations)..
